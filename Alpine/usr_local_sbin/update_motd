#  This is run during boot-up, and the intended usage case is if you want to
#  update /etc/motd every time this boots. For instance if it should indicate
#  the current iSH release, if you are using TestFlight, this might be updated
#  between runs without human intervention. It could happen also with AppStore
#  but not on a near daily basis.
#  hostname might also change between boot-ups.
