# If you've configured your hostname to be updated through an iOS Shortcut,
# this ensures that the hostname reflects what the Shortcut provides.
# If you maintain a static hostname in /etc/hosts, this may not be necessary,
# but keeping it enables quick updates in case you decide to switch to
# a hostname fed by the Shortcut in the future.
# For more about this, see: /opt/AOK/Docs/hostname-shortcut.md

#  Update motd (in case iSH has been updated)
#  On iSH we get console before this is executed despite the fact that
#  sysinit actions are supposed to happen before conssole is activated
#  This means first boot after new iSH will show outdated version
#  on bootup

#  iSH typically does no cleanup at shutdown, it just suddenly terminates.
#  When starting up openrc in default it often finds state of services as
#  already running thus leaving them as is, ie wont try to start them at all
#  since according to the states openrc finds is that default is already
#  the current runlevel.
#  Workaround is to toggle between runlevels.
#  This leads to services first being stoped and then started, ensuring
#  they start up regardless of logged runstate at startup.
