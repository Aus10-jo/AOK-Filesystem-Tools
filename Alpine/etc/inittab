#  Update motd (in case iSH has been updated)
#  On iSH we get console before this is executed despite the fact that
#  sysinit actions are supposed to happen before conssole is activated
#  This means first boot after new iSH will show outdated version
#  on bootup

::sysinit:/usr/local/sbin/update_motd

#
#  iSH typically does no cleanup at shutdown, it just suddenly terminates.
#  When starting up openrc in default it often finds state of services as
#  already running thus leaving them as is, ie wont try to start them at all.
#  One simple workaround is to toggle between runlevels, first set boot
#  then default. This leads to default services first being stoped and then
#  started, ensuring they start up regardless of logged runstate at startup.

::sysinit:/sbin/openrc boot
::wait:/sbin/openrc default

#  I highly doubt these states can be triggered in iSH
