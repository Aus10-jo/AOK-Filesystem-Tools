# TODO

## Investigate respawn issue

it seems a respawn process only is run once

## breakout network check from dynamic_login to separate app

## aok more options

- option for logging console to pts/0
- option for lsunch cmd: default, aok default, custom
- should bat lvl be displayed in colors yes/no
- bat levels default / custom
- bat lvl colors


## /usr/local/sbin/dynamic_login

When used as a Launch cmd, and autologins to a zsh user
the console session is logged out after a copple of minutes  - investigate

- ensure NavKey.md has correct paths


## update DEVUAN_SRC_IMAGE

since it is about to become more usefull, i should update it to ensure it is in line with the debian image when it comes to what is installed out of the door

## Start working on using a working /run


## Seems to be issues with latest  mdcat on 3.18

investigate and if confirmed, try to find latest version that can be used, and add it to set of custom apks
in Alpine/setup_alpine.sh


## Using /dev/console within the iSH limitations

This actually works much better in Debian than in Alpine, since in Alpine as of now only autologin as root works. agetty fails to change ownership of /dev/pts/0 on Alpine


1 Add this as Launch cmd to avoid harmless but annoying error msg everytime ish is started and offensive login BEFORE init is run, but still ensure /dev/pts/0 is bound
`/bin/sleep infinity`


2 Replace console with this alternate content in /usr/local/sbin/fix_dev if you use it via inittab, otherwise  run it in a shell as root, in order to ensure anything can print to
/dev/console, without being restricted when agetty locks down /dev/pts/0
With this normal bootup console output can be seen!

```sh
#rm -f /dev/console && mknod -m 666 /dev/console c 5 1
rm -f /dev/console && mknod -m 222 /dev/console c 136 0
```

3a Add this towards end of /etc/inittab if you want a login prompt for console screen

```
pts0::respawn:/sbin/agetty pts/0 linux
```

3b Alternatively use this if you want to use -a to login as a user without prompting for password, be aware that in this case logout / exit will instantly automatically log you back in again ðŸ™‚  You will have to use shutdown to terminate the iSH app

pts0::respawn:/sbin/agetty -a root pts/0 linux

IMPORTANT UPDATE: Please be aware that in Alpine you cant use pts0 as an inittab identifier for whatever reason, despite it being no longer than 4 chars, in such cases labeling it as tty1 works and will give you a prompt.
On Debian pts0 works, and makes more sense since it hints what device this is using

## Remove obsolete file

Alpine/usr_local_bin/apk_find_pkg.sh it is now apk_find_pkg

## Wait for bootup to complete

This could be used from /etc/profile for bash/ash and from /etc/zprofile for zsh

It needs to be cheap enough to not noticeably delay future login shells
Here are my current ideas

- Simplest, but assumes runbg is an active service...
Check if /run/openrc/options/runbg/pidfile exists and is newer than /run/runlevel
- If AOK_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX="Y" and ish-AOK this is quite cheap and quick
`while ! hostname | grep -q '\-aok' ; do`
- Uses ps ax, so has a crash risk, probably not ideal
`while ! ps ax | grep [i]nit | grep -q '\[2\]'; do`

rest of this code block

```sh
    echo "waiting for bootup to complete"
    sleep 2
done
```



##  Make it more clear how to refer to self during deploy


When the deploy starts its pretty clear what `hostfs_is_alpine` and
`destfs_is_alpine` is refering to. However when the destfs boots up and
does a large part of the deploy itself, shouldnt it be the host?

Perhaps it should be seen as a chroot thing. If something is working
chrooted on a buildhot it would make most sense to see that as a
destfs in this context, but if the same deploy steps happens on the
deploy target, running the deploy as its primary env it would ssem to be
the hostfs. More clarity about how to refer to different roles needs to
be found.


## iSH Debian

When prebuilding /etc/opt/AOK is created in the host FS prior to chroot
