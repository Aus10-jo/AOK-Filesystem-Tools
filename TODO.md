# TODO

## Alpine app versions

htop from A 3.14
apk add lua5.3

## init.d

must be kept

rc

## /etc/opt/AOK

Investigate how it is created and make sure everything using it can handle
its absence

## vnc_start / stop

Verify the new grep check works as intended

## Hostname issue during deploy if AOK_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX is used

Currently only the suffixed hostname is stored in the hosts file.
During FIRST_BOOT_ADDITIONAL_TASKS if some script is run as a user, that
needs to do a sudo, that sudo fails (current guestemate being due to the unsuffixed hostname not being in hosts)

Next aproach, reconsider the order of related tasks

- use ALT_HOSTNAME_SOURCE_FILE
- if set to /etc/hoss
  - Prompt requesting hostname
- Set /etc/hostname

Tasks that could be put into aok_launcher
advantage: less dependence on opernrc, fairly simple code logic
disadvantage: depends on aok_launcher in fact being the launch command

- hostname_sync.sh
- ensure_hostname_in_host_file
- /usr/local/sbin/update_motd

Unsorted other tasks

- Install alternate hostname (not strictly needed on iSH-AOK)
- Install hostname service
- Install hostname_sync.sh
- Install ensure_hostname_in_host_file

## Launch Command

make get/set _launch_command to as far as poosible use the same codes
make templates for expecte defaults avilable to tools needing them

aok_launcher

## /etc/environment

Set it with a reasonable PATH

## aok more options

- option for logging console to pts/0
- option for lsunch cmd: default, aok default, custom
- should bat lvl be displayed in colors yes/no
- bat levels default / custom
- bat lvl colors

## Remove obsolete files

Alpine/usr_local_bin/apk_find_pkg.sh it is now apk_find_pkg

## Start working on using a working /run

Investigate if anything can be simplified / needs to be changed given
that /run is now clean at boot time for iSH-AOK, and asuming
dynamic_login is the Launch cmd, this is also the case for regular iSH
hm perhaps this cleanup of /run should be the first inittab task instead?

## make tools/shellchecker.sh a standalone tool

an improvement would be to make it a generic tool, then just keep
something like .shellchecker in the top dir of a project, defining
exclusions

## Seems to be issues with latest  mdcat on 3.18

investigate and if confirmed, try to find latest version that can be used, and add it to set of custom apks
in Alpine/setup_alpine.sh

## Using /dev/console within the iSH limitations

This actually works much better in Debian than in Alpine, since in Alpine as of now only auto-login as root works. agetty fails to change ownership of /dev/pts/0 on Alpine

1 Add this as Launch cmd to avoid harmless but annoying error msg everytime ish is started and offensive login BEFORE init is run, but still ensure /dev/pts/0 is bound
`/bin/sleep infinity`

2 Replace console with this alternate content in /usr/local/sbin/fix_dev if you use it via inittab, otherwise  run it in a shell as root, in order to ensure anything can print to
/dev/console, without being restricted when agetty locks down /dev/pts/0
With this normal bootup console output can be seen!

```sh
#rm -f /dev/console && mknod -m 666 /dev/console c 5 1
rm -f /dev/console && mknod -m 222 /dev/console c 136 0
```

3a Add this towards end of /etc/inittab if you want a login prompt for console screen

``` inittab
pts0::respawn:/sbin/agetty pts/0 linux
```

3b Alternatively use this if you want to use -a to login as a user without prompting for password, be aware that in this case logout / exit will instantly automatically log you back in again ðŸ™‚  You will have to use shutdown to terminate the iSH app

pts0::respawn:/sbin/agetty -a root pts/0 linux

IMPORTANT UPDATE: Please be aware that in Alpine you cant use pts0 as an inittab identifier for whatever reason, despite it being no longer than 4 chars, in such cases labeling it as tty1 works and will give you a prompt.
On Debian pts0 works, and makes more sense since it hints what device this is using

## Wait for bootup to complete

runlevel default should, do, can something else be done if openrc is not used?

This could be used from /etc/profile for bash/ash and from /etc/zprofile for zsh

It needs to be cheap enough to not noticeably delay future login shells
Here are my current ideas

- Simplest, but assumes runbg is an active service...
Check if /run/openrc/options/runbg/pidfile exists and is newer than /run/runlevel
- If AOK_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX="Y" and ish-AOK this is quite cheap and quick
`while ! hostname | grep -q '\-aok' ; do`
- Uses ps ax, so has a crash risk, probably not ideal
`while ! ps ax | grep [i]nit | grep -q '\[2\]'; do`

rest of this code block

```sh
    echo "waiting for bootup to complete"
    sleep 2
done
```

## Make it more clear how to refer to self during deploy

When the deploy starts its pretty clear what `hostfs_is_alpine` and
`destfs_is_alpine` is refering to. However when the destfs boots up and
does a large part of the deploy itself, shouldnt it be the host?

Perhaps it should be seen as a chroot thing. If something is working
chrooted on a buildhot it would make most sense to see that as a
destfs in this context, but if the same deploy steps happens on the
deploy target, running the deploy as its primary env it would ssem to be
the hostfs. More clarity about how to refer to different roles needs to
be found.

## Investigate respawn issue

it seems a respawn process only is run once

## /usr/local/sbin/dynamic_login

When used as a Launch cmd, and autologins to a zsh user
the console session is logged out after a copple of minutes  - investigate

- ensure NavKey.md has correct paths

## update DEVUAN_SRC_IMAGE

since it is about to become more usefull, i should update it to ensure it is in line with the debian image when it comes to what is installed out of the door
