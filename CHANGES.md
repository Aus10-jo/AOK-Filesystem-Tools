# Changes

I will try to keep track of changes between releases here

## Changes newest first

- improved cleanup of processes after chroot, also works when ps axe is not available

## release 0.9.6

- Sorted out the issue with do_chroot.sh, added a check that kills any stray processes created inside the chroot

## release 0.9.5

- Added warning not to start openrc service on Debian chroot with a Linux host. It will force you to reboot in order to reclaim /dev
- New Debian src-img: Debian10-4-aok-2.tar.gz
- Since all services are disabled in the src_img no longer any need to manually diable them during deploy. Has been so for ages, had just forgotten about it
- filtering more env variables before chroot
I spent a ridicilos time trying to use env -i, but with no success
so far, what ends up happening is that the HOME is undefined in the chrooted env. Pretty sure its a trivial fix if you have that know-how - I unfortunately dont.
common_AOK/cron/periodic
- cron (dcron for Alpine) will always be installed and configured
The service will only be activated if USE_CRON_SERVICE is "Y"
- common_AOK/etc/skel/.tmux.conf - Fixed typo
- nav_keys.sh - Can now be used in scrips, give desired navkey as param
- removed Debian/etc/init.d/runbg - I figured out that the generic openrc runbg works just as fine on Debian
- removed some utils - fingers purpose illudes me on a one user system, and the option to automount /iCloud has made a sepate util redundant
common_AOK/usr_local_bin/finger
common_AOK/usr_local_bin/iCloud


## release 0.9.4

- Adding repo https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing Both for edge and rescent Alpine releases. For non edge releases testing is hidden behind @testing
- Alpine/usr_local_sbin/update_motd now can extract Alpine relese both from regular releases and edge ones.
- Rewrote handling of edge releases, now integrated with rest of build.
- For Alpine builds, check that ALPINE_VERSION is defined

## release 0.9.3
