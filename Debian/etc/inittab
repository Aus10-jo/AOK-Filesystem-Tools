#  These two items should be the very first sysinit entries
#  to ensure iSH is in a usable state for openrc!

#
#  hostname is not set automatically since iOS 17, since iSH-AOK can
#  set hostname the normal way with `hostname -F /etc/hostname`
#  the custom hostname is only used during bootup, to retrieve hostname
#  from the shortcut

# Clear /run/openrc to an initial state with no services running
fx2::sysinit:/usr/local/sbin/reset-run-dir.sh

#  Not system critical but we might as well do it here
#  instead of creating a full service for the task

#
# Initialization command
# Normally this would be sysinit, but when this is choosen
# on Debian running on iSH-AOK, init & openrc fails
# to transition over to the runlevel default.
# This is solved by using boot as initial runlevel on iSH-AOK

si::sysinit:/sbin/openrc boot

# What to do in single-user mode.

# /etc/init.d executes the S and K scripts upon change
# of runlevel.
#
# Runlevel 0 is halt.
# Runlevel 1 is single-user.
# Runlevels 2-5 are multi-user.
# Runlevel 6 is reboot.
