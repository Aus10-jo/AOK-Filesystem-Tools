#  This is run during boot-up, and the intended usage case is if you want to
#  update /etc/motd every time this boots. For instance if it should indicate
#  the current iSH release, if you are using TestFlight, this might be updated
#  between runs without human intervention. It could happen also with AppStore
#  but not on a near daily basis.
#  hostname might also change between boot-ups.

#
#  Sample setup that displays release info
#

# motd_file="/etc/motd"
# aok_release="/etc/aok-release"

# echo "===>  Welcome to: $(hostname)  <===" > "$motd_file"
# echo "Alpine release: $(cat /etc/alpine-release)" >> "$motd_file"

# if [ -e "$aok_release" ]; then
#     echo "AOK release: $(cat $aok_release)" >> "$motd_file"
# fi

# echo "iSH release: $(cat /proc/ish/version)" >> "$motd_file"

# echo "" >> "$motd_file"
