#  This service reads the GPS and discards the output to /dev/null.
#  So this is not tracking you in any way. The sole purpose of this
#  is that this is the only way to ensure an iOS program continues to run
#  in the background.
#  This process has no noticeable impact on battery life.

#  The above is all that is needed to have cat /dev/location > /dev/null
#  run as a simple daemon with pid being monitored.
#
#  The below parts are just adding some additional sanity, not needed
#  in order for the daemon to work by itself.
#
#  Pointless to have more than one thing doing this.
#  The below aborts with error if:  cat /dev/location
#  is already running.
#  And displays warning if other processes are detected
#  after stoping.
