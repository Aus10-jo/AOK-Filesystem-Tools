#  this is called by 'shutdown' and does the actual shutdown procedure.
#
#  If shutdown was a single script and was triggered in a remote
#  session, the 'openrc shutdown' bellow would most likely terminate
#  that session, thereby pottentially aborting the shutdown before
#  it completes.
#
#  Thus this, the actual shutdown is run in a separate backgrounded
#  script that will ignore if the triggering session disapears.
#
#  Apropriate warnings and abort possibility are offered in 'shutdown'
#
#  Triggering this one unintentionally will shutdown the system without
#  any warning. Therefore it should not have a shebang, forcing
#  the caller to really want to run this.

#  Terminates all running services, not completing until all are done.
#  During this, most remote sessions will be terminated...

#  Havent fully figured out if login or init should be killed
#  on iSH-AOK killall -9 login  results in an ish crash popup,
#  but the app is gone. killall -9 login init seemingly kills it
#  but the app window is still there if it was not in FG, and wont
#  close until it is made the FG app
#
echo "will do   killall -9 login init" >> /var/log/shutdown.log
#  Should be a guaranteed insta-kill of iSH
killall -9 login
echo "completed killall -9 login init" >> /var/log/shutdown.log
