#  this is called by 'shutdown' and does the actual shutdown procedure.
#
#  If shutdown was a single script and was triggered in a remote
#  session, the 'openrc shutdown' bellow would most likely terminate
#  that session, thereby pottentially aborting the shutdown before
#  it completes.
#
#  Thus this, the actual shutdown is run in a separate backgrounded
#  script that will ignore if the triggering session disapears.
#
#  Apropriate warnings and abort possibility are offered in 'shutdown'
#
#  Triggering this one unintentionally will shutdown the system without
#  any warning. Therefore it should not have a shebang, forcing
#  the caller to really want to run this.
