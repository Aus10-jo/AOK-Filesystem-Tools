This is not intended to be a tutorial on tmux, but rather a quick 
overview of a few of the custom features in the standard config that
comes with AOK.

Probably my favorite feature of tmux is the ability to divide the screen
into 'panes'.  Before I talk about that I need to mention that tmux
'commands' and generally invoked by first typing "Control-B" followed 
by another keystroke.  To use panes you need to know the following three
key combinations.  Note you will have to start tmux first by typing...

tmux

The first two commands allow you to divide the screen either vertically
or horizontally.

Control-B |     # Split window vertically
Control-B -     # Split window horizontally

Finally you need to know how to switch between the panes.

Control-B o     # Cycle through the panes

Bonus command:

Control-B q     # Show pane numbers, press number to go to that pane

There are many other useful tmux commands.  Do a web search for 
'tmux cheat sheet' if you want a more complete version of this short
tutorial or 'tmux tutorial' to find more extensive documentation.  You
can also simply type...

man tmux
