## Removable

apts that can be removed to create a smaller FS whilst not making FS
unbootable, work in progress, and since most usage cases at this point
is probably devels, removing compilers might be counter productive.

```bash
locales
manpages-dev
gcc
binutils-i686-linux-gnu
cpp
cpp-8
dmsetup
dmidecode
rsyslog
make
libc-dev-bin
libgcc-8-dev
linux-libc-dev
```
