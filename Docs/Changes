Alpha Series
.1   o Proof of concept
.20  o First public release
        o Added openrc
.30  o Second public test release
        o Added modified networking script to /etc/init.d to allow networking
          to "start" which in turn allows apache2 to start.  Apache2 appears to
          work but I did very minimal testing
        o Added mosh
        o Moved sshd host key generation to enable_sshd where it belongs
        o Added Emmanuel Rouat's bash_profile for ish user, modified it a bit to work 
          with iSH
        o Added fortune program because I can.  Included it in default bash_profile
        o Modified /etc/init.d/hostname to always return success so that we can 
          services with dependencies on it
        o Attempted to add both syslog-ng and then rsyslog.  Both cause programs
          that log to wedge.  They run fine under openrc otherwise
	o Added dcron.  Minimal testing at this point.  It starts, runs and appears to 
          work.  Attempted to use fcron first but it depends on a working logging 
          system which we don't currently have
	o Added elinks text based web browser to base install
	o Start dcron in enable_sshd.  Which is hacky and sucky but I'm 
	  doing it anyway for now
	o Added the nano editor base install because apparently some people like it.
          <shudder> :-)
.40  o Third public test release
	o copy bash_profile to /root in addition to /home/ish
	o Moved project to github
	o Fixed issue with executable bit not being set on stuff in /usr/local/bin
	  after pull from github
        o Wrote script to build image in chroot enviornment.  It's fairly lame but works.  
	  'chroot_build_image'
	o Added fake /etc/network/interfaces file to hopefully make /etc/init.d/networking a 
	  bit happier
	o Found apparent bug in BusyBox chroot in regards to soft links made by apk's during 
	  install.  Worked around vi build script
	o I now leave a copy of the AOK build environment in /AOK on the root image.  You can 
		+ sudo bash
		+ cd /AOK
		+ ./chroot_build_image
		+ You will now have an identical root image in /tmp/AOK (Assuming you made no 
		  changes)
.50  o Fourth public release.  I need to spell check this
	o Added zsh to core RPM's
	o Started to implement VARS file in image builds
	o Create wrapper for /bin/login to assure that the ish user always logs in initially.
	  Alas /bin/login doesn't work as expected.  
	o Switched ish user to zsh
	o Switched ish user back to bash, zsh is too slow but still available
	o Login is now required.  With password set it is possible to login directly as root.  
	  With no password set for ish it logs in fine though
	o busybox vi renamed to vi.real, vim hard linked to vi.  IE, vim is invoked when vi is 
	  typed
.55   o Fifth public test release
	 o Added coreutils apk, which replaces many of the busybox versions of binaries including df and tar
         o Found fix for timezone issue.  Currently it requires eitehr a custome tzdata apk or
	   copying a fixed version of the database stuff during the build.  This is fixed in the 
	   Edge version of Alpine.
	 o General cleanup in prep for put to github
