Alpha Series
.1   o Proof of concept
.20  o First public release
        o Added openrc
.30  o Second public test release
        o Added modified networking script to /etc/init.d to allow networking
          to "start" which in turn allows apache2 to start.  Apache2 appears to
          work but I did very minimal testing
        o Added mosh
        o Moved sshd host key generation to enable_sshd where it belongs
        o Added Emmanuel Rouat's bash_profile for ish user, modified it a bit to work 
          with iSH
        o Added fortune program because I can.  Included it in default bash_profile
        o Modified /etc/init.d/hostname to always return success so that we can 
          services with dependencies on it
        o Attempted to add both syslog-ng and then rsyslog.  Both cause programs
          that log to wedge.  They run fine under openrc otherwise
	o Added dcron.  Minimal testing at this point.  It starts, runs and appears to 
          work.  Attempted to use fcron first but it depends on a working logging 
          system which we don't currently have
	o Added elinks text based web browser to base install
	o Start dcron in enable_sshd.  Which is hacky and sucky but I'm 
	  doing it anyway for now
	o Added the nano editor base install because apparently some people like it.
          <shudder> :-)
.40  o Third public test release
	o copy bash_profile to /root in addition to /home/ish
	o Moved project to github
	o Fixed issue with executable bit not being set on stuff in /usr/local/bin
	  after pull from github
        o Wrote script to build image in chroot enviornment.  It's fairly lame but works
