#  Environment variables defining how this AOK-FS should be setup
#

#
#  Variables used during build.
#  Recomended is to copy this file to .AOK_VARS and make changes there.
#  This file will be ignored by git, and overrides this file. It also
#  minimizes risk of temp changes to become unintentionally permanent.
#  Only when you think a change should be saved into git, put it here!
#

#
#  Label for AOK builds, is also displayed by motd to indicate what
#  AOK FS release is being used
#
AOK_VERSION="0.9.2-3"

#
#  If defined this will be created as a no-password sudo capable user
#
USER_NAME="ish"

#
# Shell for user USER_NAME (if defined)
#
USER_SHELL="/bin/bash"

#
#  Replaces /root and user home dir with pre-defined content, if defined
#
# HOME_DIR_USER="/iCloud/ish_config/home_user.tgz"
# HOME_DIR_ROOT="/iCloud/ish_config/home_root.tgz"

#
#  Alternatives are: enable disable once
#
INITIAL_LOGIN_MODE="enable"

#
#  Should normally not be set! If you want to hard-code timezone,
#  The FS will be setup without giving the option to select time-zone.
#  During testing its a convenient thing to set, not having to select a TZ
#  for every install.
#
# AOK_TIMEZONE="Europe/Berlin"

#
#  If you run both iSH-AOK and regular iSH on the same device
#  this setting modifies the hostname for aok kernels to have -aok suffix
#  So my iPad JacPad would be calling itself JacPad-aok if you check
#  `hostname` on iSH-AOK and JacPad if you check on regular iSH
#
# AOK_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX="Y"

#
#  If you manually want to add something to the new FS, before deploy
#  begins. Remember that from the outside, the new FS is located at
#  $TMPDIR/AOK/FS
#  I use this when I want to simulate a mounted /iCloud env like what I
#  would have on my iPad, whilst testing the FS on a linux host chrooted
#  If the FS is being compressed its /iCloud is first cleared, so
#  anything you put in /iCloud will only be available for chrooted
#  sessions on the build host.
#  This one it is better to define in .AOK_VARS
#
# POPULATE_FS="rsync -ah /home/jaclu/iCloud $TMPDIR/AOK/FS"

#
#  Use this if you have your own restore procedure.
#  If defined, this will be run after deploy has completed, at a time
#  when it should be running inside a full AOK FS
#  If this is a script, it must be available with this PATH on the new
#  FS, that means it most likely needs to be in the iCloud mount.
#
# FIRST_BOOT_ADDITIONAL_TASKS="/iCloud/deploy/additional-tasks"

#
#  If LOG_FILE is defined build progress printed is also logged to this
#  file. This is mostly useful as a debugging tool, if during the deploy
#  something goes wrong and iSH crashes. This way you can at least get
#  an idea of how far things progressed before something broke.
#  This one it is better to define in .AOK_VARS
#
# LOG_FILE=/var/log/aokfs-build.log
