#  Environment variables defining how this AOK-FS should be setup
#

#
#  Variables used during build.
#  Recomended is to copy this file to .AOK_VARS and make changes there.
#  This file will be ignored by git, and overrides this file. It also
#  minimizes risk of temp changes to become unintentionally permanent.
#  Only when you think a change should be saved into git, put it here!
#

#
#  Label for AOK builds, is also displayed by motd to indicate what
#  AOK FS release is being used
#
AOK_VERSION="Beta-003"

#
#  If defined this will be created as a no-password sudo capable user
#
USER_NAME="ish"

#
# Shell for user USER_NAME (if defined)
#
USER_SHELL="/bin/bash"

#
#  Alternatives are: enable disable once
#
INITIAL_LOGIN_MODE="enable"

#
#  Should normally not be set! If you want to hard-code timezone,
#  The FS will be setup without giving the option to select time-zone.
#  During testing its a convenient thing to set, not having to select a TZ
#  for every install.
#
# AOK_TIMEZONE="Europe/Berlin"

#
#  Use this if you have your own restore procedure.
#  If defined, this will be run after deploy has completed, at a time
#  when it should be running inside a full AOK FS
#  If this is a script, it must be available with this PATH on the new
#  FS, that means it most likely needs to be in the iCloud mount.
#  This one is also better to define in .AOK_VARS
#
# FIRST_BOOT_ADDITIONAL_TASKS="/iCloud/spd/bin/deploy-ish"

#
#  Should normally not be changed! Enabling his will create a limited env
#  missing features and functionality!
#
#  Purpose is to speed up the deploy cycle when testing and improving
#  the build processess on slow devices, by cutting down on deploy heavy
#  usability features.
#
#  Valid settings
#  --------------
#  0 - Disabled, full deploy will happen
#  1 - all quick deploy options are active, CORE_APKS will not be installed
#  2 - CORE_APKS will be installed, all other QUICK_DEPLOY conditions will
#      be followed. Handle this in your .AOK_VARS something like this:
#
#      if [ "$QUICK_DEPLOY" -gt 1 ]; then
#          #
#          #  Minimal list that will generate a usable system depends
#          #  on how you use it
#          #
#          CORE_APKS="openrc openssh-client bash"
#      else
#          #  Normal build - Skipping fortune, some like it I don't :)
#          CORE_APKS="$(echo "$CORE_APKS" | sed 's/fortune//')"
#      fi
#
QUICK_DEPLOY=0

#
#  If you run both aok and regular iSH on the same device
#  this setting modifies the hostname for aok kernels to have -aok suffix
#  So my iPad JacPad would be calling itself JacPad-aok if you check
#  `hostname` on iSH-AOK
#
# AOK_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX="Y"
