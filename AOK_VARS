#  Additional packages.  These don't work with stock iSH but work with iSH-AOK

#  Use this if you have your own restore procedure.
#  If defined, this will be run at the end of first boot, at a time when
#  it should be a full AOK FS
#  If this is a script, it must be available on the final FS

#
#  Please never enable this here. If you want to hard-code timezone,
#  please put this variable with your TZ preference in .AOK_VARS
#  If not hardcoded, /usr/local/bin/set-timezone will be run during
#  setup, allowing user to select timezone.

# AOK_TIMEZONE="Europe/Amsterdam"


#
#  Additional APK groups managed with /usr/local/bin/aok_groups
#
#  Any variable ending with _APKS in this file, will be seen as a package group
#  by aok_groups and with that tool you can add/delete groups more conveniently
#  than having to open this file and then do cut/paste repeatedly.
#
#  You can add/modify all the groups to your liking.
